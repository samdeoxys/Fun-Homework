# Fun-Homework
The PSet for CPNS 35600 Theoretical Neuroscience: Statistics & Information Theory that I enjoyed the most. 
It involves spike-triggered average, spike-triggered covariance and linear-nonlinear poisson model. I was awestruck by the predictive power of this simple model. The detailed description can be found in `CPNS_35600_Problem_Set_3.pdf` 2-5.

The code is designed to run in MATLAB R2018a. Cannot run in a version earlier than R2014b because of the `histcounts` function.
## How to use
Download and unzip all the files, make sure they are in the MATLAB path, and run `hw3.m`.
